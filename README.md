# SoftwareEngineeringFinalProject
The goal of this website was to provide a platform that facilitates collaboration and communication between students, instructors, and TAs. The motivation for this project roots in our experience as college students. We noticed that the traditional methods of instructions like textbooks, lectures, and office hours are less engaging and flexible for students. This application tries a new approach that provides a collaborative and engaging environment. Our product serves as an online communication platform between students, instructors, and TAs. Students can post questions on our platform and others can reply and provide feedback. Our overall goal is to enhance the learning experience by creating a more collaborative and engaging environment for students and instructors alike.
